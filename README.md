# Domain Driven Design Made Functional

- [Glossary]

## Working example

The book uses a realistic example to explore DDD.

### Problem statement

We’re a tiny company that manufactures parts for other companies: widgets,
gizmos, etc. We’ve been growing quite fast and our current processes are not
able to keep up. Right now, everything we do is paper-based, and we’d like to
computerize all that so that our staff can handle larger volumes of orders.
In particular, we’d like to have a self-service web site so that customers can
do some tasks themselves. Things like placing an order, checking order status,
etc.
